# This is my Memory Game!

## What is a Memory Game
This simple game was made to test your memory. Flip cards over and match icons.

## Instructions
Match cards two at a time before timer runs out.

## How I built it.
I manipulated the DOM with Vanilla JS, altered part of the HTML and also styled the game
* created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
* created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
* added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
* create a pop-up modal when player wins game
